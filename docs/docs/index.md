# calciumImagingAnalysis (ciapkg)

`calciumImagingAnalysis` (ciapkg) is a software package for calcium imaging analysis of one- and two-photon imaging datasets.

This user guide provides documents to setup, run, and troubleshoot `calciumImagingAnalysis`.

Note: `calciumImagingAnalysis` is a class with various GUIs to allow processing of calcium imaging data. In addition, users can access the underlying `ciapkg` functions to make custom workflows. See [Custom command-line pipelines](help_example_pipeline.md).
