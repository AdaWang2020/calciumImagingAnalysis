# Tracking

Code for ImageJ and Matlab based image tracking.

# ImageJ based tracking

Functions needed (have entire `miniscope_analysis` loaded anyways):

- `mm_tracking.ijm` is the tracking function for use in ImageJ, place in
`plugins` folder.
- `removeIncorrectObjs.m` is a function to clean-up the ImageJ output.
- `createTrackingOverlayVideo` is a way to check the output from the
tracking by overlaying mouse tracker onto the video.

## Instructions for ImageJ and Matlab
Example screen after running `mm_tracking` within ImageJ, click to expand.

Once ImageJ is finished, within Matlab run the following code (cleans up the ImageJ tracking by removing small objects and adding NaNs for missing frames along with making a movie to check output). Modify to point toward paths specific for your data.
```Matlab
% CSV file from imageJ and AVI movie path used in ImageJ
moviePath = 'PATH_TO_AVI_USED_IN_IMAEJ';
csvPath = 'PATH_TO_CSV_OUTPUT_BY_IMAGEJ';
% clean up tracking
[trackingTableFilteredCell] = removeIncorrectObjs(csvPath,'inputMovie',{moviePath});
% make tracking video
% frames to use as example check
nFrames=1500:2500;
inputMovie = loadMovieList(moviePath,'frameList',nFrames);
[inputTrackingVideo] = createTrackingOverlayVideo(inputMovie,movmean(trackingTableFilteredCell.XM(nFrames),5),movmean(trackingTableFilteredCell.YM(nFrames),5));
playMovie(inputTrackingVideo);
```
